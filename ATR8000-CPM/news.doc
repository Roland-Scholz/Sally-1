NEW CP/M PACKAGE RELEASED FOR THE ATR8000
-----------------------------------------

   SWP  Microcomputer Products Inc.  will be distributing a  much 
enhanced  version  of CP/M 80 for the ATR8000  computer  sometime 
after  late  April or early May 1984.  This package will  include 
many new features requested by SWP customers since the last  CP/M 
release in March 1982. Anyone who has purchased  CP/M from SWP in
the past may obtain a copy of the new software for $25. 

   The  new  software includes changes to the existing CP/M  bios 
and utility programs as well as some completely new programs  and 
facilities.  A summary of the changes or additions to each of the 
major CP/M building blocks is given below.

--- BIOS ---

   The  main changes in the bios have been in the area of  double 
sided  disk formats.  The old bios could not distinguish  between 
single  and  double sided disks.  This caused a lot of  headaches 
when trying to copy files between the two types of media, and led 
to  the rather exasperating restriction that you had to  make  an 
intermediate  single density copy of the files you were   moving. 
The new bios now allows you to operate on a single sided diskette 
in  a  drive that is configured for double sided  operation.  The 
double  sided  disk format has also been changed,  from  the  old 
style where the lower 1/2 of the tracks were on side 0, to a more 
universal format where the even numbered tracks are on side 0 and 
the  odd  tracks  on side 1 (the  so-called  "interleaved"  track 
format). This format is superior because it reduces the amount of 
head  movement needed in most disk operations and thus speeds  up 
the average access time. The old sytle DS formats have been added 
to the DISKDEF program so you will have no trouble copying  files 
from older DS disks.  A number of other lesser modifications have 
been made to the bios, and these are listed below.

1)If  you type a ^C with a non-system disk in drive A:,  the bios 
  will issue a disk error instead of trying to load garbage  into 
  memory in place of CP/M.
2)Provisions have been made to allow the execution of an auto-run 
  program after booting CP/M for the first time.
3)More space has been made available for disk data structures. It 
  is  now  posible to have 4 DS/DD 8 inch drives without  running 
  out of memory in the bios.
4)The  disk configuration mechanism has been  simplified.  It  is 
  only  necessary  to  set  the NTRACKS byte for  each  drive  to 
  configure for double sided, quad density etc.
5)The  physical  disk  handler in the bios has been  expanded  to 
  allow  the inclusion of user defined disk i/o code for  special 
  applications.  This  mechanism  is used by the new  version  of 
  DISKDEF described below.
6)The  bios error messages for NOT READY and WRITE PROTECTED have 
  been  replaced  by numbered error codes similar those  used  by 
  the  other types of disk errors (as described in the  ATR  CP/M 
  manual on   page 27). 


--- DISKDEF ---

   The  DISKDEF program has been expanded to allow operation with 
a  number  of disk formats previously unusable  by  the  ATR8000, 
particularly in the area of double sided formats. A wide range of 
different  DS/DD  formats are now possible  including Kaypro  IV, 
Epson  QX10,  Morrow  and all the old  ATR8000  formats.  Another 
bizarre format that can now be read is the Superbrain,  which has 
inverted  data similar to Atari disks.  The DISKDEF program  will 
continue to be expanded both by SWP and outside contributors.  If 
you  have  a  CP/M disk format that you would like added  to  the 
list,  please send a sample disk with some files on it (long text 
files  are  good) to SWP's technical  support  department,  along 
with  a note describing as much as possible about the format  and 
the machine that created it.  We will attempt to keep an  updated 
version of DISKDEF available at all times.

--- DDINIT ---

   The  disk initialization program has been modified so that the 
option to format single or double sided is now one of the prompts 
issued when the program is run. Previously it was not possible to 
format  double sided unless you had first created a double  sided 
CP/M  system. Some new features have also been added for  special 
less frequently used applications.  These features are invoked by 
typing  a slash and an option character after the command to  run 
DDINIT.  There  are currently three such options  available.  The 
/Q  option allows you to format 80 track double  sided  diskettes 
(sometimes  called  quad density),  the /D option allows  you  to 
format  40  track disks in an 80 track drive  by  double  steping 
between  tracks,  and  the /0 option makes the  formatter  create 
disks  with the starting sector number being zero (instead of one 
as in the standard IBM format).


--- DDSYSGEN ---

   DDSYSGEN  has been expanded to include the functions  provided 
by the CP/M utility program MOVCPM. This allows you to generate a 
CP/M system with an arbitrary memory size from 20K up to 60K. The
relocation  feature is envoked by typing DDSYSGEN 0XX <cr>  where 
XX is the page address of where the CCP begins in memory. This is 
D4  hex for a 60K system and one less than D4 for each 256  bytes 
less  than  60K.  For example DDSYSGEN 0D0 <cr> generates  a  59K 
system, and DDSYSGEN 034 <cr> would create a 20K system. The free 
space created by generating a less than 60K CP/M will occupy  the 
area  just below the monitor at F000 hex and extending down below 
there for the amount specified.  In a 59K system this would  mean 
that the area from EC00 to EFFF would be unused by CP/M. When the 
sysgen  program is run in the 'MOVCPM' mode just  described,  the 
normal  main menu is bypassed and the program goes immediately to 
the  symbolic patch function after generating the relocated  CP/M 
system  image in memory.  At this point you can either write  the 
system onto a disk in drive A: or else exit DDSYSGEN and save the 
memory image onto a file by typing SAVE 69 CPMxx.COM. A few minor 
features of the user interface in DDSYSGEN have been altered, but 
these  are  trivial  enough  that the  program  should  still  be 
operable by someone familiar with the old version of DDSYSGEN.


--- CONFIG ---

   This  is a newly written utility program for the ART8000  that 
provides a painless,  user friendly way to create customized CP/M 
system  boot disks.  CONFIG is the program that allows you to set 
the printer type,  the serial port baudrate,  the number and type 
of disk drives,  the size of the TPA etc.  without having to know 
anything  about  the  inner  workings of the  parameters  in  the 
ATR8000 bios.  Simply run CONFIG and answer the questions and  it 
will construct a customized CP/M for you. Upon completion, CONFIG 
automatically  loads the DDSYSGEN program so that the new  system 
can be written onto a boot disk. This program will only work with 
the new version of CP/M from SWP, so please do not attempt to use 
it with the previous bios and/or utility programs.
