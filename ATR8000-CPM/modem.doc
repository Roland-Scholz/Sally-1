              PUBLIC DOMAIN CP/M MODEM PROGRAM
              ================================
                        Version 3.6
                  Adapted by Walter Blady
	Upgraded to version 3.7 by Jim Mills, CACHE.

      A MODEM UTILITY PROGRAM SPECIALLY CONFIGURED FOR
       THE ATR8000 COMPUTER WITH 64K RAM AND CP/M 2.2


                          FOREWORD

     This program was originally MODEM7.MAC written by 
Ward Christensen and revised by M.Zeiger and J.Mills for the
PMMI modem board.  Full credits for expertise and talent 
that made this program possible, belong solely to these 
people.

     Many other individuals contributed to the developement 
of this program,  but mentioning them and their 
contributions here would make this file somewhat 
unmanagable.  Rightful credits are documented in various 
versions of MODEM.  My appologies.

     Many additional routines included are copyrighted 
(1980) by Mark M.Zeiger and J.Mills.  Permission is granted 
to use, but not to sell these routnes.


     Enhancements were added to the original program to 
take advantage of Smartmodem's Auto Dial feature, Escape to 
Command Mode and On Hook features.

These features include...

     - Kill a disk file.
     - Terminal mode/Echo mode toggle.
     - List device toggle, (terminal mode).
     - Send/receive object-code informal file (terminal mode).
     - CRC - (cycle redundancy check option).
     - Auto line-feed is generated in the Echo mode.	
     - Greatly enhanced menu.
     - Display number of file sectors in decimal and hex
       during SEND/RECEIVE file.
     - XON-XOFF recognition in transfer informal file mode.
     - Telephone directory
     - The telephone directory is a separate file.  This allows
       fast editing without the need to recompile the modem
       program.  Also, many directories may be accessed.
     - Auto-dial from internal directory to SMARTMODEM.
     - Direct dial from program intiation or from menu.

                   COMMANDS IN MENU MODE
                    DETAILED EXPLANATION

                           *****

WRITE INFORMAL FILE TO DISK - 'WRT'
-----------------------------------
     For the porpose of definition, an 'Informal file' is 
one which is set-up for recieving or transmitting data,
without data validity checks, in the terminal mode.

     When data has been saved to an 'Informal file', the 
file must be closed before continuing with other options.  
The 'WRT' command writes all remaining buffered data to the 
disk and then closes the file.  Information will be lost 
if this is not done.


DELETE INFORMAL FILE - 'DEL'
----------------------------
     This command will delete the 'Informal file' and it 
won't be saved on the disk.  All information held in memory 
from previous saves will be erased.


RETURN TO TERMINAL MODE - 'RET'
-------------------------------
     The 'RET' command is used to re-enter the terminal mode 
with no data loss.

     If information has been saved to an 'Informal file', 
the user may re-enter the menu mode, but all saved data 
will be lost if a return to the terminal mode is made with 
the 'T or E' options. Using the 'RET' allows re-entry to the 
terminal mode and preserves all saved information.


SET BAUDRATE AND PARITY - 'SET'
-------------------------------
     This command allows the user to set the baudrate and
parity of the modem port. To use the command simply type 'SET'
followed by a carriage return. The current baudrate will be
displayed on the screen, at which time the user can display the
next value by typing on the space bar. When the desired new baudrate
is displayed it can be selected permanently by typing a carriage
return. The parity setting is handled in the same way.
     The parity setting only affects transmitted data. Received
data always has the parity bit forced to a zero if odd or even
parity is selected. Select the no parity option when using the
'formal' file send/receive functions of SMODEM.


AUTO-DIAL (SMARTMODEM) - 'CAL, C'
---------------------------------
     The Auto-dial feature allows the user to call a number
automatically from one of several phone directories.

     Auto-dial primary option may be used in three different 
ways when initiating SMODEM:

eg. Initiate and ask for directory name.

    SMODEM C		
            ^
       (primary option)

eg. Initiate and load the default directory 'PHONE.001', then
dial the number associated with the directory letter 'M'.

    SMODEM C M
              ^  
      (directory-letter)

eg. Initiate and dial the given number.

    SMODEM C 231-1898
                 ^
            (any number)

     Auto-dial may also be used from the MENU mode with 'CAL',
The commands are exactly the same except the code 'CAL' is
used instead of the 'C' primary option.

     If the command 'CAL' is used alone, SMODEM will ask for
a directory name.

     When the phone directory is up, any number in 
the directory may be dialed by entering a 'directory-letter 
and pressing return.  Or any number may be typed in the 
command line.  The dial command 'ATD' and the selected 
number are automatically sent to the SMARTMODEM.

     If you wish to cancel a call while the phone is ringing,
press return. The 'NO CARRIER' message will be sent and 
SMARTMODEM will go to an on hook (hang-up) state.  To redial
the same number, give the command 'A/'.  All the standard 
HAYES commands can be issued while in the terminal mode.

     A second option for dialing a number is from the terminal
mode, using the standard SMARTMODEM dial command.  Simply type 
ATD <phone number>


TELEPHONE DIRECTORY
-------------------
     Directories may be given any name and kept on any disk, 
but there must always be a 'Default directory' with the name
'PHONE.001' on the default drive.  SMODEM automatically loads
this file if a direct dial is called for.

     Phone directories may be set-up in two different ways; 
(see the models below).  These models could be saved to  
separate files and used as actual directories.  More may be 
set up by duplicating the model over and over.  Only the 
entries need be changed.


EXPERT MODE - 'XPR, X'
----------------------
     If the 'X' option is included in the command line when 
SMODEM is initiated, it will come up with the menu display 
turned off.  The menu may be toggled on and off during run-
time with the 'XPR' option. Therefore it is best to run with
the menu off and toggling to it only when necessary, this 
action permits messages to be seen that would otherwise be
lost due to the menus clear screen function.


DIRECTORY - 'DIR <d:>'
----------------------
     This option prints the specified disk directory to the 
screen.


RE-ENTER CP/M - 'CPM'
---------------------
     This option terminates the modem program and returns to 
the cp/m operating system.


KILL A DISK FILE - 'K file.name'
--------------------------------
     Files may be deleted from the disk without leaving the 
modem program.  CP/M rules apply.

eg. >>K file.name,  >>K *.ASM,  >>K B:file.A?M


               PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OPTIONS
                    DETAILED EXPLANATION

                           *****

     There are eight primary options in SMODEM.

     Originate and Answer options are not used since 
SMARTMODEM handles these automatically.  

     A primary option may be included in a command line when 
initiating SMODEM, or while in the menu mode, but only ONE is 
allowed.  The exception is with 'T', 'M' and 'E'.  They may be
used as secondary options during 'send' or 'receive'

     S... Send a file       R... Receive a file 

     T... Terminal mode     E    Echo mode 

     X    Expert mode       C... Auto-dial mode 

     M    Menu mode         K... Kill a CP/M file

     There are twelve secondary options. These options may 
be entered in a command line when initiating SMODEM or
while in the menu mode.  

     More than one secondary option may be included in a 
command line.  If the (CRC) option is used, then a maximum of 
six may be included.  As you can see, 'T', 'M' and 'E' are 
also used as secondary options.


...S Print to screen/sending	...R Print to screen/receiving

...V Print send & receive	...Q Don't print messages

...T Return to Terminal mode	...E Return to Echo mode

...D Disconnect			...B Batch files mode

...C (CRC) request		...M Return to Menu mode	
     cyc. redundancy check
     (option in receive only)     

...A Answer Tone connect	...O Originate Tone connect
	to phone line.		to phone line.

               SENDING/RECEIVING WITH SMODEM

                           *****

              (Sending/Receiving FORMAL Files)


     The clasification 'FORMAL' means that all transmitted
data are checked for validity against received data.  There
are two data-check options available. (See information below.)

     If a primary option is used in a command line when 
initiating SMODEM, it must be the first character following 
the name SMODEM, with one space preceeding it.  Secondary 
options immediately follow the primary, with no spaces.
Secondary options may be entered in any order.

     eg. SMODEM SQT B:file.name
                 ^
        (primary option) 

The above command line means:
  
  SMODEM...Initiate SMODEM
        S...Send a file
        Q...Don't print any system messages on the screen
        T...After the file is sent, go to the terminal mode
       B:...The file is on drive B:
file.name...The name of the file to be sent
            (File names may contain ambiguous references,
            according to the rules of CP/M)

     The 'B' batch file secondary option may ONLY be used 
from the menu mode.  It may not be included in a command 
line during initiation of SMODEM.

     Command lines entered from the menu mode are virtually 
the same, except the word 'SMODEM' is not typed.

     eg. >>RRD file.name
           ^
    (primary option)

The above command line means:

        R...Receive a file
        R...Type the file to screen as it is being received
        D...Disconnect the phone after the file is received
file.name...The name of the received file.  
            (The file.name doesn't have to match the sender's.
            Ambiguous reference in file.name is NOT allowed 
            with the receive option.)

     When sending a batch of files, ambiguous references may 
be used according to the rules of CP/M.  

     eg. >>SBST *.BAS

        S...Send files
        B...Batch mode
        S...Print files to the screen as they're being sent
        T...When through, enter the terminal mode
    *.BAS...Send all the files on the default disk with the 
            extention of 'BAS'.

     eg. >>SBCM file.name1 file.name2...n

        S...Send files
        B...Batch mode
        M...Enter the menu mode after all files are sent
file.name...The list of files to be sent.


     When receiving files in Batch mode, the file names are 
NOT specified.  They are sent by the sender.  SMODEM 
automatically receives and uses these names on the disk.
 
     eg. >>RBCE

        R...Receive files
        B...Batch mode
        C...Send a (CRC) character redundancy request to the 
            sender specifying a (CRC) check of data instead   
            of the default CHECKSUM method.
        E...Go to the Echo mode after all files have been
            received.


             (Sending/Receiving INFORMAL Files)


     Files may be sent or received from the Terminal mode.
The clasification 'INFORMAL' simply means that data validity
checks are NOT made on transmitted data. (You takes your 
chances.)

     To save data to an informal file, a file.name must first 
be specified in the menu mode while giving the 'T' terminal 
command.  The user is the asked if the received data is 
object code.  (All data is either object code or ASCII.)

     eg. >>T file.name

     Once in the terminal mode, any incoming data may
be saved to this file by simply pressing the '^R' receive
toggle.  Data may be intermitantly saved by toggling on or 
off.  As soon as all desired data is saved, the file must be 
closed with the 'WRT' command, from the menu mode.  Incoming 
material may be temporarily stopped and started by issuing the
'^S' XOFF' and '^Q XON' commands.

     To send an informal file, the '^T' transmit command is
given from the terminal mode.

     eg. ^T

     Following this command the user is asked if the file
to be sent is 'object code', then prompted for the file.name.
The data is sent immediately following a carriage return, so 
care must be taken that the receiver has enough time to
prepare.


                       OPTION SUMMARY

                           *****

                      PRIMARY OPTIONS
                      ===============

SEND A FILE - 'S...'
--------------------
     Send CP/M files individually or in batch mode using 
CHECKSUMS or CRC checks.


RECEIVE A FILE - 'R...'
-----------------------
     Receive CP/M files individually or in batch mode using 
CHECKSUMS or CRC checks.


TERMINAL MODE - 'T <file.name>'
-------------------------------
     Enter terminal mode (without echo.).  If <file.name> is
specified, then an informal file is set up and data may be
saved to this file using the (Receive) ^R' toggle.


ECHO MODE - 'E'
---------------
     Enter echo mode.  Echo all characters back to the 
sender.  Auto line feeds are sent following each carriage 
return.  Both terminals may NOT be in echo mode at the same 
time or SMODEM will go boobs up.


EXPERT MODE - 'X'
-----------------
     This mode surpresses the menu display upon initiation 
of SMODEM.


AUTO-DIAL (SMARTMODEM) - 'C <command>'
--------------------------------------
     Dial a number directly or display the telephone 
directory and wait for command.


                     SECONDARY OPTIONS
                     =================

ANSWER TONE - 'A'
-----------------
     Selecting this option tells the smartmodem to go online
using answer (higher frequency) tones.

ORIGINATE TONE - 'O'
--------------------
     Selecting this option tells the smartmodem to go online
using originate (lower frequency) tones.  If neither 'A' or 'O'
are specified, SMODEM will assume you are already online and
begin whatever command you gave it.

SHOW FILE AS SENT - 'S'
-----------------------
     Selecting this option will display the file being sent, 
on the screen.


SHOW FILE AS RECEIVED - 'R'
---------------------------
     This option will display the file being received, on 
the screen.


SHOW FILE - 'V'
---------------
     Display sent or received file on the screen.


QUIET MODE - 'Q'
----------------
     Surpress all system messages; (don't display on the 
screen).


TERMINAL MODE - 'T'
-------------------
     Enter the terminal mode.  <file.name> may not be 
specified when when using 'T' as a secondary option.


DISCONNECT (SMARTMODEM) - 'D'
-----------------------------
     Issue the 'Escape' code to the HAYES SMARTMODEM, then 
hang up the telephone and re-enter the menu mode. 


BATCH MODE - 'B'
----------------
     This option is used to send multiple files.

     File names can be individually specified in the command 
line, or they can be specified using ambiguous file names 
(CP/M convention).  Individual file names are sent to the 
receiver first, then the file contents, until all files are 
sent.


(CRC) cycle redundancy check - 'C'
----------------------------------
     SMODEM defaults to a 'checksum' method of checking data 
validity during send/receive.  Although quite accurate, it 
is not virtually error free.  The secondary option 'C' may 
be included in the command line to force a (CRC) check of 
data. The (CRC) methode is 99.99% error proof.  The only 
restrictions are:

   - Both sender and receiver must use one of the MODEM series
     programmes that have the (CRC) option.

   - The (CRC) option may only be included in a RECEIVE 
     command line.

     If SMODEM detects a request for (CRC) during a 
SEND file, it automatically switches over and informs the 
operater with a screen message.


                   TERMINAL MODE OPTIONS

                           *****

OFF-LINE - ^O
-------------
     This command will allow re-entry to the menu mode 
without disconnecting the phone.


END OF FILE - ^Z
----------------
     This command sends an end of file ASCII character.


XOFF - ^S
---------
     The XOFF character tells the sending computer to stop 
data transmission temporarily.  (The sender must recognize
XON/XOFF protocol).  XOFF is used in conjunction with the XON.


XON - ^Q 
--------
     The XON character tells the sending computer to resume 
data transmission.


TERMINAL/ECHO (TOGGLE) - ^E
---------------------------
     Switching between Terminal mode and Echo mode can be 
accomplished by pressing ^E.  A message is printed to warn if 
ECHO ON or ECHO OFF.


PRINTER (TOGGLE) - ^P
---------------------
      All incoming data may be sent to the printer while in 
terminal mode. This feature does NOT operate while receiving 
a file using the 'R' (receive) primary option.  A message is 
printed warning if PRINTER ON or PRINTER OFF.  


TRANSMIT INFORMAL FILE - ^T
---------------------------
     This command will send a disk file informally (without 
error checking).

     After pressing ^T, the user is prompted for the 
file.name, and if the file being sent is object code.  
The file is immediately sent following a carriage return.
The transmission can be terminated with the cancel key ^X.  


OBJECT CODE (SCREEN PROMT)
--------------------------
     Object code files may be SAVED or SENT while in the 
terminal mode.  The user is prompted during informal file 
transfer/receive as to whether an object code file is being 
transmitted.  There are no checks to ensure data validity, 
therefore this feature should only be used when it is not 
possible to use the 'R' (receive) or 'S' (send) primary 
options.


RECEIVE INFORMAL FILE (TOGGLE) - ^R
-----------------------------------
     The receive toggle may be used only if a <file.name> was 
specified when entering the terminal mode.

eg.  T <file.name>

     Alternately pressing 'R' turns the save feature ON and 
OFF and the user is prompted with 'SAVE ON' or 'SAVE OFF' 
message.  When the save function is ON, data is 
simultainiously saved and printed on the screen, and each 
printed line is preceded by a colon ':' (The colon is not
sent to the file.)

ECHO MODE (TOGGLE) - ^E
-----------------------
     Alternately pressing this key toggles between the 
terminal mode and echo mode.  The user is prompted with an 
'ECHO ON' or 'ECHO OFF' message.


DISCONNECT (SMARTMODEM) - ^D
----------------------------
     This key sends the SMARTMODEM default escape code '+++'  
then issues the command 'ATH' causing the modem to go to 
an ON-HOOK state (hang up).  


CANCEL SEND/RECEIVE - ^X
------------------------
     This key may be used to cancel files being sent or 
received in the informal mode, or files being sent using the 
primary option 'S'.  Files being received with the primary 
option 'R' can't be cancelled by the receiver.  This ensures 
that line noise doesn't inadvertantly stop transmission.     


                      PHONE DIRECTORY

                           *****

     Two types of directory formats may be set up.

(a) TWO ENTRIES PER LINE
------------------------

     The directory itself begins with the letter 'A' and
ends with the'$'.  'A' MUST BE THE FIRST CHARACTER IN THE 
FILE. (No CR/LF pairs preceding it.)  Do not include the 
spacing guide below.
