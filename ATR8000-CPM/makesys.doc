Installing a Customized Version of CP/M
---------------------------------------

   This is your master CP/M system disk. 
It  should  be kept in a safe place  and 
only  be  used to make  copies.  If  you 
would  like  to make a working  copy  of 
CP/M from this master, please follow the 
steps  outlined below.  

1) Run  the  DDINIT program and  make  a 
   supply of initialized diskettes. Read 
   about  this  function in the  ATR8000 
   manual  if  you are  unfamiliar  with
   disk formatting.
2) Put this disk  back in drive  A:  and 
   run the CONFIG program.  This program 
   will ask a series of questions  about 
   your  system and create a  customized 
   CP/M to your specifications.
3) When CONFIG asks you to insert a disk 
   to write the system onto,  remove the    
   master disk from drive A:, put in one 
   of  the  disks  made in step  #1  and 
   press return. 
4) Wait  until the  program asks if  you 
   would  like to repeat step  #3.  Then 
   press the reset button on the ATR8000 
   and re-boot CP/M using the newly made 
   disk.
5) Use  PIP to copy  the files from  the 
   master CP/M disk onto your new  empty 
   system disk.  If you have two drives, 
   this is done by putting the master in
   drive  B:  and typing  the  following 
   command.

   B:PIP A:=B:*.*[V]

   If you have configured the system for 
   only  one  disk drive,  this  command 
   will  still  work  but  you  will  be 
   prompted to change diskettes in drive 
   A:  whenever  PIP switches  back  and 
   forth  between  the master disk  (B:) 
   and the copy disk (A:).
